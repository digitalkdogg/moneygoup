🧑‍💻 Story 1.1 — Create and manage a watchlist

As a user
I want to add and remove stocks from my watchlist
So that only selected symbols receive ongoing data updates.

Acceptance criteria

I can add a stock by symbol

I can remove a stock

Only watchlist stocks are scheduled for updates

🧑‍💻 Story 1.2 — Daily price ingestion for watchlist stocks

As a system
I want to fetch daily OHLCV data for watchlist stocks
So that I have consistent time-series data for modeling.

Acceptance criteria

Prices are fetched once per trading day

Only missing dates are retrieved

Data is stored in stocksdailyprice

No duplicate rows are created

🧑‍💻 Story 1.3 — Bi-daily price refresh (optional)

As a system
I want to optionally refresh prices pre-market
So that my dataset reflects the most recent close.

Acceptance criteria

Pre-market refresh does not duplicate daily data

Refresh can be enabled/disabled via config

🧑‍💻 Story 1.4 — Derived feature computation

As a system
I want to compute derived metrics from price data
So that the AI model does not rely on external APIs.

Examples

daily % change

moving averages

volatility

RSI

Acceptance criteria

Derived metrics are computed locally

Computation runs after data ingestion

No API calls are made during feature generation

🧑‍💻 Story 1.5 — Fundamentals ingestion (slow-moving)

As a system
I want to periodically fetch company fundamentals
So that the model can use contextual features like market cap.

Acceptance criteria

Fundamentals are fetched weekly or monthly

Missing data is allowed

Source is recorded (Tiingo / FMP)

Fundamentals are never fetched during AI runs

🧑‍💻 Story 1.6 — AI-ready data access

As a user
I want a clean, consistent dataset for modeling
So that buy/sell recommendations are reproducible.

Acceptance criteria

AI reads from DB only

Dataset is ordered and gap-checked

No API calls occur during modeling

🧑‍💻 Story 1.7 — API usage safety

As a system
I want to log API calls
So that I can audit and control usage.

Acceptance criteria

Each call logs source, symbol, purpose, timestamp

Watchlist updates never exceed configured limits

🔍 EPIC 2: Stock Search & Evaluation (Bucket 2)
Goal

Allow quick, low-cost evaluation of stocks before adding them to the watchlist.

🧑‍💻 Story 2.1 — Search for stocks

As a user
I want to search for stocks by name or symbol
So that I can explore potential candidates.

Acceptance criteria

Search returns symbol, name, exchange

Results are fast (< 2s)

Search works even if fundamentals are missing

🧑‍💻 Story 2.2 — View evaluation snapshot

As a user
I want to see a snapshot of key stock information
So that I can decide whether to track it.

Example fields

current price

market cap (if available)

sector / industry

52-week range (optional)

Acceptance criteria

Snapshot data is best-effort

Missing fields are clearly indicated

Data is not persisted long-term

🧑‍💻 Story 2.3 — Cache search results

As a system
I want to cache search responses
So that repeated searches do not waste API calls.

Acceptance criteria

Cached results are reused within TTL

Cache expires automatically

Cache does not trigger background jobs

🧑‍💻 Story 2.4 — Add stock to watchlist

As a user
I want to add a searched stock to my watchlist
So that it begins receiving regular updates.

Acceptance criteria

Stock moves from SEARCH → WATCHLIST state

Historical price backfill is triggered

Fundamentals ingestion is queued

Search cache entry may be discarded

🧑‍💻 Story 2.5 — Prevent accidental data pollution

As a system
I want to ensure search actions do not affect watchlist data
So that API usage stays controlled.

Acceptance criteria

Search never triggers historical fetch

Search never writes to stocksdailyprice

AI model never sees search-only stocks

🧠 EPIC 3: System Integrity & Observability
🧑‍💻 Story 3.1 — Track data freshness

As a user
I want to see when data was last updated
So that I trust the recommendations.

Acceptance criteria

Each stock shows last price update time

Stale data is clearly indicated

Acceptance criteria

UI renders with partial data

No retry loops for missing fundamentals

Data source is visible

🧑‍💻 Story 3.3 — Manual refresh controls

As a user
